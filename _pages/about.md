I am a PhD student at IIT Delhi, and am advised by Dr. Mausam and Dr. Parag Singla. I work in the broad area of fairness in ML, with a particular focus on mitigating gender bias amplification by ML models.

I did my Master at IISc Bangalore where I explored a wide-range of topics, with research projects in NLP and Deep Learning.

I received Ericsson Research Fellowship (2018-19) during my Masters.
